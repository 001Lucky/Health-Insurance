## Conclusion
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the insurance dataset,had key factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region were identified as significant influencers of medical insurance charges. Notably, smokers consistently incur higher premium costs compared to non-smokers, and insurance charges generally increase with age and BMI. These insights highlight the importance of lifestyle and demographic factors in determining healthcare costs. The findings from this analysis provided a strong foundation for developing predictive models that can accurately estimate insurance premiums, helping ABC Insurance make more informed, data-driven business decisions
